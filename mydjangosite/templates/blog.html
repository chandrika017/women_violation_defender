      The Sreepur Village is often the first place where each woman wakes up knowing that she will be safe, will receive nutritious meals, and will have the company and friendship of other women in similar circumstances.

Every month, the mothers hold a meeting where they discuss life at the Village, any problems and any suggestions for improvements. They also have singing and dancing sessions in smaller groups each week which have turned out to be extremely popular, and a great way for these women to build their confidence. Self-esteem is an important part of learning to manage independence and we provide group and individual counselling to lessen the impact of the abuse and loneliness that they have suffered in the past.

While they live with us, we pay them a small allowance each month plus a compulsory savings scheme where we put money in a bank account so that they have funds when they leave. Each year, the women vote to increase their savings rather than their monthly allowance – a welcome sign that they have started to appreciate that they need to plan for the future.

Most women have few parental skills so they attend training on child rights, managing behaviour, nutrition and health. After the first year, each woman will spend time working as a khala (auntie) responsible for the care of the children.

Length of stay

Each family lives with us for up to three years. For three months prior to discharge, each mother lives with her children in our Halfway House which sits on the perimeter of the village with a gate out into the local community. It has a tube well, water pump and village kitchen so that the families can learn to live together as a small unit before they leave us. We still have more work to do on our post-discharge monitoring, but we stay in touch with each family for a few months to make sure that they settle into community life and that they have sufficient income to live at a reasonable level.
